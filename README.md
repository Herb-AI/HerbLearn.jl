# HerbLearn.jl
Machine Learning module of Herb

This module takes care of preprocessing, i.e., representation of data, training and prediction of models.


## Comments:
The combination of `PyCall` and configuring the correct conda environment is a bit tricky/non-trivial for now. Julia can handle Conda environments automatically and we will leverage this.
